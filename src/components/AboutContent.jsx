                    Hello, I'm AgustÃ­n from Santa Fe, Argentina. I'm 25 years old. I started to programming almost a year ago,
                    and I feel like I found something really exciting! 
                    Before starting my career as a programmer, I spent my time studying and working in 
                    economics and accounting, respectively.
                    I'm looking for my first experience in the IT world ðŸ¤ž
